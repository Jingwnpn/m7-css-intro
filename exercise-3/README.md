# Instructions

1. In this directory, start a local server. Go navigate to localhost in your browser to look at our starting point.
2. Open up the index.html file and get a good idea of what elements make up our page.
3. Follow the instructions in the comments of the index.html file.
4. Host your site on your student server (I suggest in a file structure such as info343/lab1)
